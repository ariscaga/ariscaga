# Hi, I'm Ariana (@ariscaga)

**Creator of Organizational Ambient Intelligence (OAI³) | Founder, CosentriQ**

I study organizations as living intelligence systems—and explore how AI can function as an interface to that intelligence rather than a tool to be “adopted.”

My work focuses on why most AI initiatives fail at the organizational level, and what becomes possible when intelligence is made ambient, integrated, and usable inside real workflows.


## Current Focus
OAI³ Framework** — Organizational Ambient Intelligence Infrastructure - Intelligence flow and decision architecture - How intelligence moves, blocks, and degrades inside organizations - AI as interface layer, not adoption target 
**CosentriQ** — Applied OAI³ in real organizational contexts

## Background
- Founder, CosentriQ  
- Previously scaled DivySci to $1M+ ARR in   
- Backed by Google, AWS, and National Science Foundation  
- Work spans organizational intelligence, AI systems, and decision infrastructure  

## Technical Context
**AI / Systems:** LLMs · RAG · Multi-agent systems · Decision modeling  
**Backend:** Python · Node.js · PostgreSQL  
**Frontend:** React · TypeScript
